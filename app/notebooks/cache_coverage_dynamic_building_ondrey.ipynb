      "Answer: ('Technology is used for **solving problems, automating tasks, improving efficiency, and facilitating communication**.\\n\\nIts primary applications include the creation of tools, systems, and methods designed to achieve specific goals, enhance capabilities, and improve living standards.\\n\\n**Major Domains:** Technology is most utilized across **Information Technology (IT)**, **healthcare/medicine**, **manufacturing and industry**, **transportation**, and **energy production**.\\n\\n**Driving Forces:** Technology development is fundamentally driven by the human needs for **survival and security** (e.g., defense, agriculture), the desire for **convenience and efficiency** (e.g., automation), and the constant pursuit of **knowledge and exploration**.', False, 'None')\n",
      "What is information?\n",
      "Answer: ('Information is **data that has been processed, organized, structured, or presented in a given context so as to make it useful**. It is the meaning derived from data, providing knowledge, insight, or understanding.\\n\\n**Relationship to Data:** Information is distinct from, but built upon, data. Data consists of raw facts, figures, or symbols that are unprocessed. Information is the resulting output after that data has been analyzed, interpreted, or transformed to provide meaning.\\n\\n**Criteria for Value:** For information to be considered valuable, it must meet essential criteria, including **accuracy** (free from errors), **timeliness** (available when needed), **relevance** (applicable to the task at hand), and **completeness** (containing all necessary facts).\\n\\n**Role in Decision-Making:** Information plays a critical role in organizational decision-making by reducing uncertainty, allowing managers to evaluate potential outcomes, identify risks, and formulate strategies that align with business objectives.
