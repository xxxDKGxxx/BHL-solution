What is a function?,"('A function is a relation between a set of inputs and a set of permissible outputs with the property that **each input is related to exactly one output.**\n\nIn mathematics, a function maps an element from the **domain** (the set of possible inputs) to exactly one element in the **codomain** (the set containing all possible outputs). Functions are often denoted using the notation $f(x)$, where $f$ is the function and $x$ is the input value. The set of actual outputs produced by the function is called the **range**. The primary rule governing a function is that it must pass the **vertical line test** (meaning no input value, $x$, can yield two different output values, $y$).', False, 'None')"

What is the limit of a function?,"('The **limit of a function** describes the value that a function approaches as the input (or independent variable) gets closer and closer to a particular value.\n\nFormally, the limit of a function $f(x)$ as $x$ approaches a number $c$ is denoted as $\\lim_{x\\to c} f(x) = L$. This means that as $x$ gets arbitrarily close to $c$ (but not necessarily equal to $c$), the value of $f(x)$ gets arbitrarily close to the value $L$. For the limit to exist at point $c$, the limit approaching from the left side must equal the limit approaching from the right side. The concept of the limit is foundational to calculus, enabling the formal definitions of continuity, derivatives, and integrals.', False, 'None')"
What is the derivative of a function?,"('The **derivative of a function** measures the instantaneous rate at which the function\'s value changes with respect to a change in the input variable.\n\nGeometrically, the derivative $f\'(x)$ (read ""f prime of x"") at a specific point $x$ is equivalent to the **slope of the tangent line** to the function\'s graph at that point. Physically, the derivative represents the instantaneous rate of change; for example, if the function describes position over time, the derivative describes instantaneous velocity. Mathematically, the derivative is formally defined using the limit of the difference quotient:\n\n$$f\'(x) = \\lim_{h\\to 0} \\frac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{h}$$\n\nA function must be **continuous** at a point for its derivative to exist there, although continuity alone is not sufficient (e.g., a sharp corner, like in $|x|$, prevents differentiability). The process of finding a derivative is called **differentiation**.', False, 'None')"
What is a definite integral?,"('A **definite integral** is a mathematical concept used to calculate the net accumulated quantity of a function over a specified interval.\n\nGeometrically, the definite integral of a function $f(x)$ from a lower limit $a$ to an upper limit $b$ represents the **net signed area** between the curve and the x-axis over that interval. It is formally defined using the limit of a **Riemann sum**, where the area under the curve is approximated by summing the areas of an infinite number of infinitesimally thin rectangles:\n\n$$\\int_{a}^{b} f(x) \\, dx$$\n\nThe value of the definite integral can be calculated using the **Fundamental Theorem of Calculus (Part 2)**: if $F(x)$ is the antiderivative of $f(x)$, then $\\int_{a}^{b} f(x) \\, dx = F(b) - F(a)$. Unlike the indefinite integral, the definite integral always yields a single numerical value, not a family of functions.', False, 'None')"

What is the Pythagorean theorem?,"('The **Pythagorean theorem** is a fundamental relation in Euclidean geometry among the three sides of a **right triangle**.\n\nThe theorem states that in any right triangle, the area of the square whose side is the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the areas of the squares whose sides are the two legs (the other two sides). Algebraically, if $a$ and $b$ are the lengths of the legs and $c$ is the length of the hypotenuse, the formula is:\n\n$$a^2 + b^2 = c^2$$\n\nThis theorem is only valid for right triangles in flat (Euclidean) space.

What does mathematical induction prove?,"('Mathematical induction is a rigorous proof technique used to establish that a given property, statement, or proposition holds true for **all natural numbers** (or any infinite sequence that follows a countable pattern).\n\nSpecifically, mathematical induction **proves** that a proposition $P(n)$ is true for every integer $n$ starting from a base case (usually $n=1$ or $n=0$). The proof requires two mandatory steps:\n\n1. **Basis Step:** Show that the proposition $P(n)$ is true for the initial value (e.g., $P(1)$ is true).\n2. **Inductive Step:** Assume the proposition $P(k)$ is true for an arbitrary integer $k \\ge 1$ (the Inductive Hypothesis), and then prove that $P(k+1)$ must also be true.\n\nThis method is justified by the **Well-Ordering Principle** and operates like a chain reaction or ""Domino Effect"": proving the first case knocks down the first domino, and proving the inductive step shows that every domino that falls will knock down the next one, guaranteeing that all dominoes fall.', False, 'None')"

What is a convergent sequence?,"('A **convergent sequence** is an infinite sequence of numbers (typically real numbers) whose terms approach and eventually remain arbitrarily close to a specific finite value, called the **limit** of the sequence.\n\nFormally, a sequence $\\{a_n\\}$ converges to a limit $L$ if, for every positive number $\\epsilon$ (no matter how small), there exists a positive integer $N$ such that for all $n > N$, the distance between $a_n$ and $L$ is less than $\\epsilon$ ($|a_n - L| < \\epsilon$).\n\nThis is written using limit notation as:\n$$\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} a_n = L$$\n\nIf a sequence does not approach a single finite limit (meaning it either grows infinitely large or oscillates indefinitely), it is called a **divergent sequence**.
